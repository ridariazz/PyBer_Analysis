# Overview 

For this project, we will create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Using Pandas and Matplotlib, we will create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Our analysis will overall cover how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer. We will be using the Pandas groupby() function along with the count() and sum() methods on the DataFrames we will create to gather our overall analysis.

We will be creating:

- a ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type
- a multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type
